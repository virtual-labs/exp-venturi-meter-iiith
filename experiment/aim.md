The Venturi meter used in this experiment consists of successive converging, uniform and diverging sections equipped with pressure taps at selected locations.
A Ventura meter is a device for determining the flow-rate of a fluid down a pipe. One measures the pressure difference between the venture inlet and neck, and from this the flow-rate can be determined.
