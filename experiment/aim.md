The Venturi meter used in this experiment consists of successive converging, uniform and diverging sections equipped with pressure taps at selected locations.
A Venturi meter is a device for determining the flow-rate of a fluid down a pipe. One measures the pressure difference between the venture inlet and neck, and from this the flow-rate can be determined. 

The main aim is to study the variation of Cod and discharge with respect the head by plotting the following graphs:
- Q_a Vs √h
- Q_a Vs h  
Taking √h and h on x-axis and Q_a on y-axis
