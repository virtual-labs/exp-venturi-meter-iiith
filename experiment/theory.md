Venturimeter is a device used for measuring the rate of flow of a fluid through a pipe. Water is allowed to flow through the meter at different rates ranging from zero to the maximum and the corresponding pressure differences shown in the manometer are noted. The actual discharge A is determined using the measuring tank and the stop watch.
